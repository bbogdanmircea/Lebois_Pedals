# Lebois_Pedals
SW for Lebois pedals according to his site example https://lebois-racing.fr/interfaces-for-srt-pedals#arduino
HW used is https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pro-micro--fio-v3-hookup-guide/hardware-overview-pro-micro

The changes are : 
-the pins to which the pedals are connected. I use A3 for clutch, A2 for brake, A1 for gas.
-the range of the ADC values that I measure for each sensor, this is very important
